I built a location-based clubs and community event discovery and booking platform where users can search and join events like marathons, cycling, workshops, tech meetups, and social drives using event name, location, and intelligent filters.
The platform supports both free and paid events with real-time bookings, QR-based tickets, and secure payments with automatic commission deduction for the platform.
I implemented club and community management with roles like owner, moderator, and members, along with real-time event chats using Socket.io.
For scalability, I used PostgreSQL for transactional data and MongoDB for chat and activity logs, AWS S3 for secure document storage, and integrated Gemini AI for personalized event recommendations, demand prediction, and spam detection.
Overall, the system is designed as a full-scale, production-ready marketplace with AI, fintech workflows, and geo-based discovery.
